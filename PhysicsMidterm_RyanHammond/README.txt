Question1 & question 2
Controls - control movement with WASDQE, holding shift while pressing A or D will rotate the camera around the ship so that you can look backwards.
The 10 closest turrets are outlined with a purple sphere.

Queation 3
Controls - camera is controlled by WASDQE and holding shift while pressing Q or E will raise and lower the ships altitude.
Pressing F will drop the bomb -  a fire rate is in place so only one shot/second

the turrets were scaled up to make it more likely one is under the flight path.
the turret denoted by the green sphere at its base is the one that is closest.
the hit marker is a small white sphere at the location the bomb hit an object - I left the code so that even hitting the Death Star will create a hit marker, as sometimes the program might not place a turret on the flight path.
